# NERD

> NERD (No Effort Required, Done) is an LLM-native programming language - built for LLMs to write, not for human authorship. Humans observe and audit; machines generate. Agent-first by design.

## Philosophy

NERD is an experimental language exploring what programming looks like when AI writes most of the code.

- **LLM-native**: Optimized for LLM tokenization. English words instead of symbols. Each word = 1 token.
- **Not for human authorship**: Dense, terse, machine-optimized. Humans don't write it - they observe it.
- **Human-observable**: Auditable and verifiable. Plain English words make it paradoxically readable.
- **Agent-first**: Prioritizing agentic use cases - LLM calls, tool calls, orchestration.
- **Native compilation**: Compiles to LLVM IR, then to native binaries via clang. No runtime.

## The Experiment

This is an early-stage experiment. The insight: tools are absorbing integration complexity (auth, retries, rate limiting) via MCP and similar protocols. What's left for agents is thin orchestration.

NERD is exploring whether a purpose-built language for this new world makes sense. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't - but it's worth trying.

## Agent Capabilities

### LLM Calls

```
llm claude "prompt"
```

Calls Claude API. Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in environment or .env file.

### HTTP Requests

```
http get "url"
http post "url" "json body"
```

### MCP Tool Calls

```
mcp tools "url"
mcp send "url" "tool_name" "json_args"
```

Discovers and calls remote MCP tools.

## Syntax Examples

### One-Line Agent

```
llm claude "What is Cloudflare Workers? One sentence."
```

### MCP Tool Discovery and Call

```
mcp tools "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"
mcp send "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" "search_cloudflare_documentation" "{\"query\":\"Workers\"}"
```

### HTTP Requests

```
http get "https://httpbin.org/get"
http post "https://httpbin.org/post" "{\"name\":\"nerd\"}"
```

### Function Definition

```
fn add a b
ret a plus b
```

### Math Operations

```
fn add a b
ret a plus b

fn sub a b
ret a minus b

fn mul a b
ret a times b

fn div a b
ret a over b
```

### Conditionals

```
if x gt zero out "positive" else out "not positive"
```

### Multiline Conditionals

```
if x gt zero
  out "positive"
else
  out "not positive"
done
```

### FizzBuzz

```
fn fizzbuzz n
repeat n times as i
  if i mod 15 eq zero out "FizzBuzz" else if i mod three eq zero out "Fizz" else if i mod five eq zero out "Buzz" else out i
done

fn main
call fizzbuzz 15
```

### Counted Loop

```
repeat ten times as i
  out i
done
```

### While Loop

```
let x ten
while x gt zero
  out x
  dec x
done
```

### Factorial

```
fn factorial n
let result one
let x n
while x gt one
  let result result times x
  dec x
done
ret result
```

### Function Calls

```
fn square x
ret x times x

fn main
out call square five
```

### Result Types

```
type result ok num or err str

fn calc a b op
if op eq zero ret ok a plus b
if op eq one ret ok a minus b
ret err "unknown"
```

### Stdlib Math

```
ret math sqrt x
ret math pow x two
ret math sin x
ret math cos x
ret math abs x
```

## Compilation

```
NERD source (.nerd)
    ↓
  Lexer (tokenize English words)
    ↓
  Parser (build AST)
    ↓
  Codegen (generate LLVM IR)
    ↓
  clang (compile to native binary)
```

### Commands

```
nerd compile file.nerd -o output.ll    # Generate LLVM IR
nerd run file.nerd                      # Compile and run
nerd tokens file.nerd                   # Show tokens
nerd parse file.nerd                    # Show AST
```

## Token Efficiency

NERD achieves 50-70% fewer tokens than traditional languages for equivalent logic:

| Language   | FizzBuzz | Math (4 fn) |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| NERD       | 49       | 32          |
| JavaScript | 99       | 70          |
| Python     | 73       | 47          |
| TypeScript | 126      | 96          |
